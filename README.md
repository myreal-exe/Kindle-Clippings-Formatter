2) Copy "clips.txt" from your Kindle into the repository folder
3) Run the script (Python 3.x - no dependencies)
4) The output will be formatted as follows:

    a) The script will create a "{book_title}.txt" file for every book title

    b) Each "{book_title.txt}" file will contain each clipping for that book removing useless data such as the date of the clipping and chain them together with a blank new line between each other

    c) Storing all of these files in a "./clippings" output folder
